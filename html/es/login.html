            The space inside the room is divided into five sectors by lines
            drawn on the floor. In each sector the numbers from 1 to 6 are
            written in the form of dots (as on a dice). 2 is missing. Inside of
            the entrance door there is another sector about 100 x 70 cm size.
            There is a "START" mark on the border of this sector. Musicians are
            located around the perimeter of the room. In the center there is a
            black cube, half of which serves as a DJâ€™s workplace, in the second
            half located the props of Phonaid: hourglass tray with a dice, and
            accessories that the actress wears. The mouths of participants in
            the installation (except musicians) are closed with bandages. The
            clock on the wall is stopped. The door to the room is locked.

            The mistress of the room, Phonaid, goes out to the hall, take a hand
            of Protagonist and lead the Protagonist into the room. Stops it to
            the "START" line. Locks the door on her way. Goes to the cube in the
            center of the room. She takes the hourglass in her hand. She invites
            the Protagonist into the game with a gesture. As soon as he crosses
            the line, Phonaid turns the hourglass (3 minutes).
